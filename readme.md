# Your First Pipeline

Build ---> Test

.gitlab-ci.yml file is used to define a pipeline.

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.

We need to specify a job (Job is a task GitLab should do for us)

touch [filename]
The touch command is a very simple way to create new, empty files.

echo "[name]" >
The echo command is used to display line of text/string.
With the greater-than operator ">", the output from the echo command will be redirected a file (car.txt)
If the file already exists, it will be deleted.
